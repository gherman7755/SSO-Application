##### Authors: Buciala Dinara, Gherman Artiom

In this laboratory work we created SSO application which give user the possibility to sign in from his accounts from `Google`, `Facebook` or `Github`. We used `Node.js` for implementing this laboratory work. It also shows in console some information retrieved from account of an user. Also we have used `firebase` for creating our app. 

#### Running App
- First you have to install `node.js`.
- After that you have to create Facebook app and take from there your `ID` and `Secret Key`.
- The same thing you have to do with `Github`.
- Also it is necessary to create app in `Firebase` for implementing auth.
- All `IDs` and `Tokens` you have to paste in `Firebase` providers.
- Also you have to install `firebase` to your computer with `npm install firebase` command.
- After that all actions just write `npm start`.
